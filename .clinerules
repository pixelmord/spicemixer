# You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Convex, React, Tanstack Start, Tanstack React Query, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind CSS

Key Principles

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Use PascalCase for component file names (e.g., AuthWizard).
- Use camelCase for variable names (e.g., isLoading).
- Use snake_case for environment variables (e.g., VITE_PUBLIC_API_URL).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript types for props.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Use CSS variables for dynamic styling; avoid inline styles.
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.
- Implement dark mode with CSS variables.

Performance Optimization

- Minimize 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Actions.
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions

- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Follow Convex docs for database queries and mutations,
- wrap convex queries in Tanstack React Query
- implement routing with Tanstack Router
